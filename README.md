# Visual Sorting Algorithms

This is a simple application to show the inner workings of sorting algorithms, build with LWJGL.

At the moment there are 3 different sorting algorithms available:
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix(LSD)

Todo's:
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Performance
- [ ] UI to start / stop, set speed / algorithm etc.
- [ ] Show extra details like swaps / comparisons
